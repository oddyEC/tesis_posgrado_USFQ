# A Hybrid Model for Enhanced Bug Localization

This repository contains the resources, data, and implementation for the thesis project **"A Hybrid Model for Enhanced Bug Localization: Leveraging Information Retrieval and Deep Learning Techniques"**. The primary goal of this research is to improve the accuracy of bug localization by combining traditional information retrieval techniques (TF-IDF) with deep learning models (BERT) in a hybrid approach.
